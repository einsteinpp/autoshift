This program try to emulate the autoshift feature from zsa moonlander keyboard. 

I really got used to it but my daily keyboard doesn't have it and because of the odd Alt-Gr key placement (Kinesis advantage 2) I was struggling to get a decent typing experience while writing code.

The program doesn't have any window or tray icon, if you want to close it you will need to go in the task manager.
